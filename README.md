# /dev/null/nethack Tribute 2017

Scoreboard for the Devnull Tribute 2017 tournament.

In September 2017 the /dev/null/nethack organizer Krystal
announced that he is retiring the long running tournament.  A group of
players from Team Splat decided to run "Tribute" tournament in its place
in November 2017 as a quick way to have a replacement tournament.  This
code implements scoreboard that is supposed to imitiate the structure of
the original tournament.

## CONFIGURATION

The statistics generation script is configured using JSON file `dnt.conf`
that is expected to be in the current directory.  Following keys are
required:

`xlogfile`

path to tournament xlogfile.  Xlogfile can use both `:` or `HTAB` as field
separator.

`challenges`

Path to challenge status file generated by the game server.

`clandb`

Path to clans database in SQLite format.


## HOW IT WORKS

The script reads the xlogfile and other supporting data sources into memory
and compiles in-memory scoreboard structure that is then passed into HTML
templates that are used to generate actual static website. The in-memory
scoreboard is held as a tree with its top level held in the `%s` hash. The
in-memory data structure is documented below.

### PLAYERS

%s{**players**}{**data**}{*playername*}{**games**}  
Ordered list of all player's games as they appear in the xlogfile.

### CLANS

### TROPHIES
