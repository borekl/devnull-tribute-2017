# /dev/null/nethack Tribute 2017

Scoreboard for the Devnull Tribute 2017 tournament.

In September 2017 the /dev/null/nethack organizer Krystal
announced that he is retiring the long running tournament.  A group of
players from Team Splat decided to run "Tribute" tournament in its place
in November 2017 as a quick way to have a replacement tournament.  This
code implements scoreboard that is supposed to imitiate the structure of
the original tournament.
